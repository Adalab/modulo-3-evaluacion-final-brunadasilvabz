# Module 2: Final Evaluation

Hello there! Here you're going to find information about how to access my final evaluation project for module 3 of the web programming bootcamp in Adalab!

This is the final product in case you want to see it before accessing it: http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-brunadasilvabz/

> This web-page is optimized for the following screen sizes: 320px, 768px and 1024px.

## Everything you need to know about this project

My task was to make a web-page with **React** about Rick and Morty with the following functionalities and requirements:

1. Print on the web-page all the character cards using **fetch** and print only the required data about each of them (image, name and species).
2. Add a **search bar** so that the user could search for their preferred character and **create a filter** so that only those with the exact name would appear.
3. Have a **"not found" message** in case the user searches for a character that it's not on the list.
4. Create **another filter** so that the user can filter all the characters by species.
5. If the user clicks on any character, it should take them to **another page** with a more complete card of the character showing more information about it.

As this was a module 3 project, they wanted us to **focus more on React** and then work on CSS, so that we could first practice some of the following React characteristics:

- fetch
- components
- routes
- functions
- arrays
- objects

.. and of course use some **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Follow these steps to access my project!

1. Either **clone** the repository or **download** it. I recommend downloading it so that it works without any problems!

2. Use the terminal to **install dependencies** using:
   <dl>npm install</dl>

3. **Run the project** with:
   <dl>npm start</dl>

..and you're done!

I hope this project is useful to you!
